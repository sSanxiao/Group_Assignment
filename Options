Options
1: Antimicrobial resistance(statistics)
Examples:
1)Cefalexin
2)Norfloxacin
3)Isoniazid
Data Source(Official):SmiNet,Swedres-Svarm(extend to North Europe),Tuberculosis Register
Methods:basic statistics，trend analyse, data visualization，crosstab, multivariate regression models, time series analysis, Chi-Squared Test,Logistic
Knowledge:Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics, Linear Algebra

2：Analyse And Prediction(Machine Learning)
Examples:
1)Neonatal mortality projections
2)Association analysis of environmental factors and Alzheimer's disease
3)Spatial prediction of infectious disease outbreaks
4)Health Insurance Claims Fraud Detection
Data Sources(Official):WHO, CDC, Public Health Databases(GIDEON, ProMED),Epidemiological database
Methods:Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Anomaly Detection Algorithms (e.g. Isolated Forests), 
XGBoost, SVM, Geospatial Machine Learning Models, Multivariate Regression Models, Neural Networks
Knowledge:Machine Learning(Python),Neural Networks, more basic statistics

3:Early diagnosis of cancer(Based on Qilu Wang's research and thesis）
Examples, Data Sources are finished
Methods:weighted principal component analysis, correlation perturbation calculation, performance evaluation
Konwledge: R statistics

Tip 1: These three options all require foundational knowledge of machine learning and statistics,
though the weight of these two components varies across the options. 
This also reflects the mainstream and essential methods of using Information and Communication Technology in Public Health Informatics.

Tip 2：Option 3 seems easier and more mature, but this Group Assignment is related to Individual Assignment 2, 
so Different members' understanding of option 3 can lead to differences in the difficulty and amount of work in Individual Assignment 2
